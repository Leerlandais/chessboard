        I'm going to, eventually, make a working Chessboard (for 2 players, obviously I'm not gonna make it with a programmed opponent!).
        I'm gonna keep a diary of how it's going. All of this is of course visible on <a href="https://github.com/Leerlandais/chessboard"> but I'll include it here, too</a>

            16/11/2023 - Introduction to making tables using HTML. I decided to make a chessboard design. Spent some time figuring out how to apply the colouring to the board using the nth-child.

            17/11/2023 - Decide I'm going to use this as an ongoing project (outside of the work I'll be doing for the course). Will be intersting to see how it develops. At this time, I've just finished the preformation. I'm getting used to HTML, CSS and using Github. <br>
